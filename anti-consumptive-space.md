# Anti-Consumptive Space
## A public/commercial space set aside for non-consumption.

A former store or bar or club or some other commercial space in a city, potentially in New York, where people can come and comfortably not consume anything. People are welcome to talk, meditate, sit silently, think, and so on. But not to eat, drink, read, listen to music, be on devices, or any other consumptive act. Writing and other creative outlets will probably also be banned, because they too easily fall into consumption.

Upon entering, you voluntarily check bags, coats, phones, etc. at the door. There is water and bathrooms available before entering.

The space itself is potentially outfitted with cell and wifi dampeners. There is comfortable furniture to sit on, arranged to allow both semi-private and group discussions. The space is aesthetically pleasing, but should not attract attention. The focus of the space is to spend time alone or with others without needing stimulus.

To be viable, the space accepts donations online, which allow the donator to reserve a particular time. Otherwise, the space is first-come/first-serve, and has a strict limit on the number of people who can be inside.

If the rent is sufficiently low and demand high enough, this should be viable. There are very few ongoing costs outside of rent, utilities and wages for a few employees. Initial capital would be needed for furniture and marketing.

## Theory
Our society is designed around consumption. Hanging out with friends typically means going to consume food or drink or media. When you get bored and you’re alone, you turn on your computer and watch Netflix or waste time on social media instead of allowing yourself to be bored and to just think or talk, without stimulus.

Public/commercial spaces are especially prone to self-enforcing consumptive behavior. We don’t feel comfortable spending time in public/commercial spaces without consuming things. This leads to all kinds of problems, not the least of which is the escalating use of resources by successful public/commercial spaces.

The anti-consumptive space seeks to decouple public/commercial space from the act of consumption by re-appropriating public/commercial spaces and turning them into consumption-free zones, where people can feel free to go without the need (or indeed, ability) to consume. These spaces will turn formerly resource-intensive spaces into spaces that use minimal resources and, by paying a few employees to care for them, invert the cycle entirely by rewarding people for helping to reduce consumption, rather than increase it.

## Practice
The best way to test this idea may be to create this first as a limited time pop-up space, potentially within an existing commercial infrastructure such as a flea or a gallery.

## FAQ
*What is consumption?*
We define this as broadly as possible. Basically, anything that involves using something other than our bodies, for any purpose, but especially for sublimating thought that might arrive as a result of succumbing to boredom or lack of stimulus.

*What is a public/commercial space?*
A space that is either entirely public, or semi-private but open to the public if they come to consume (i.e., a commercial space). We define these two types of spaces together because the behavioral distinctions between them are minimal. Even though society provides public spaces, like parks, for leisure, there is usually pressure to behave in consumptive activity when entering them. It's rare to go to a park "just to sit," but common to go for picnics, concerts, to play sports, and so on. Meanwhile, almost all semi-private spaces in society are commercial ones, or are at least (as in the case of, say, public meeting places) geared towards consumption.

There is a need for a semi-private space one can go, alone or with people, without feeling the need to consume anything. This _could_ be a semi-private area set aside in an already public space, but we like the idea of decoupling semi-private, commercial space from consumption.

*Is enforced non-consumption — i.e., going somewhere to consume not consuming — actually just consumption?*
Potentially. This is an open question.
