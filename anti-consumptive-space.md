# Anti-Consumptive Space
## A commercial space set aside for non-consumption.

Practically: a former store or bar or club or some other commercial space in a city, potentially in New York, where people can come and comfortably not consume anything. People are welcome to talk, meditate, sit silently, think, and so on. But not to eat, drink, read, listen to music, be on devices, or any other consumptive act. Writing and other creative outlets will probably also be banned, because they too easily fall into consumption.

Upon entering they check bags, coats, etc. at the door. There is water and bathrooms available before entering. To enter, folks go through a metal detector (or wand detection) into the main space.

The space itself is potentially outfitted with cell and wifi dampeners, as well as tech to be able to detect the presence of technology, to make sure the rules are enforced. There is comfortable furniture to sit on, arranged in such a way so as to make exclusive conversations difficult, but group conversations possible. The space is aesthetically pleasing, but should not attract attention. The focus of the space is to spend time alone or with others without needing stimulus.

To be viable, the space accepts donations online, which allow the donator to reserve a particular time. Otherwise, the space is first-come/first-serve, and has a strict limit on the number of people who can be inside.

If the rent is sufficiently low and demand high enough, this should be viable. There are very few costs outside of rent and utilities. Initial capital for furniture, one or two employees, and sanitation.

## Theory
Our entire society is designed around consumption. Hanging out with friends typically means going to consume food or drink or media. When you get bored and you’re alone, you turn on your computer and watch Netflix or waste time on social media instead of allowing yourself to be bored and to just think or talk. Public society is especially rampant with this kind of self-enforcing consumptive behavior. We don’t feel comfortable spending time in public (or commercial) spaces without consuming things. This leads to all kinds of problems, not the least of which is the escalating use of resources by successful commercial spaces.

The anti-consumptive space seeks to de-escalate this rampant consumption by re-appropriating commercial spaces and turning them into consumption-free zones, where people can feel free to be in communal space without the need (or indeed, ability) to consume. These spaces will turn formerly resource-intensive spaces into spaces that use minimal resources and, by employing to care for them, invert the cycle entirely by paying people to help reduce consumption.

# Practice
The best way to test this idea may be to create this first as a limited time pop-up space, potentially within an existing commercial infrastructure such as a flea or a gallery.

# Questions
Is enforced non-consumption — i.e., going somewhere to consume not consuming — actually just consumption?
