# Computing Handbooks

Well designed web, epub, and pdf handbooks that explain aspects of computing.
Be able to teach tor, pgp, git, etc. after reading.
Insert them into spaces that already provide learning.

# School Assemblies

Travel to schools around the country and give assembly presentations on encryption.
Use pgp to send secret messages, stuff that kids would really want to know how to do.
Then run through the steps.
It's not any harder than Minecraft.
